If your healthcareai models are running out of memory or are very slow, you 
might be thinking that something is wrong with the package or that you need a 
bigger computer. While that can be frustrating, there are several tricks that 
you can use to speed things up and save memory. Read on to see some options
for using healthcareai with a large data set.

# TL;DR
If you have a dataset with more than 20k rows or 50 columns, you might run into
performance issues. The size of your data and the type of model training you use 
influence how long it will take. Some easy steps to reduce training time:

- Limit the number of columns in your data after `prep_data`.
- Categorical variables with many unique values (like zip code) create many
columns. Use `get_best_levels` or `prep_data`'s `collapse_rare_factors` to 
limit them.
- `prep_data` transforms date columns into many columns by default. Use
`convert_dates = FALSE` to prevent that.
- Limit the length of your data to more recent data or to a subset of the 
original data.
- Use `flash_models` instead of `machine_learn` to train fewer models during 
development work.
- GLM is typically faster than RF, though doesn't always perform as well.
- Use `machine_learn` or `tune_models` with faster settings. Pick 1 model, and
use a tune depth of 5.

# Expectations

The plot below provides a rough idea of how long you can expect model training to take for various sizes of datasets, models, and tuning settings. The largest dataset there, approximately 200k rows x 100 columns, requires about 30 minutes to train all three models if tuning isn't performed, and about six hours to tune all three models. 

In general, [glm tunes very efficiently](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html); however due to its linear constraints, it may not always provide a performant model. xgb is fast if tuning isn't performed, but it is a complex model for which tuning can be both important and computationally intensive. When you decide to use xgb, we recommend a final round of model tuning with `tune_depth` turned up at least several times higher than the default value of 10. Tuning time will increase linearly with `tune_depth`, so you can expect turning it up from 10 to 30 to approximately triple model training time. Both xgb and rf can be quite expensive to tune; this is a result of `healthcare.ai` exploring some computationally expensive regions in their hyperparameter space. It may be more efficient to examine the results of an initial random search with `plot(models)`, and then tune over the most-promising region in hyperparameter space by passing a `hyperparameters` data frame to `tune_models`. You can see how the default  hyperparameter search spaces are defined in `healthcareai:::get_random_hyperparameters`.

If you want to squeeze every ounce of performance from one of these models; we suggest iteratively zeroing in on the region in hyperparameter space that optimizes performance.

# Data
If you are running out of memory, it's probably because your data is too large 
for the operations that you've asked R to do. 

In general, machine learning can 
ignore useless columns. But with large data sets, it's better to use fewer 
columns that are more predictive to save computational cost. Remember, machine 
learning should be iterative. Add columns and see if they help, remove them and 
see if it hurts, try different transformations.

This document walks through some steps to help you build a better model in less
time.

Start by loading up the *flights* dataset.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
library(healthcareai)

d <- nycflights13::flights
d
```

You can get the size of a dataset with `dim`, `nrow`, `ncol` and `object_size`.
40.6 MB really doesn't seem like that much. Your computer probably has at least 
8 GB of RAM. But you are going to prepare that data for machine learning and then
train several models to see which one fits the data best. Larger data sets take more
memory and time to process. Despite its small size, if you were to train a model 
on this data, it would take a long time.
```{r}
os <- object.size(d)
print(paste("Data is", round(as.numeric(os)/1000000, 1), "mb."))
```

## Data Set Sizes
In general, 336k rows and 19 columns is large but should be workable. Keep in mind
that the data changes as you manipulate it though. For example, if we `prep_data`,
the size of the data changes. This is because `prep_data` transforms, adds, and
removes columns to prepare your data for machine learning. It will only modify
columns, never rows.

Prepping this data increased the number of columns from 19 to 155. The size went up 
an order of magnitude, to 408 MB. The categorical columns, those made up of 
characters or factors, are the reason for the extra columns, and thus, the size 
change. The amount of memory your data takes up is proportional to the number of 
cells in the table, rows times columns.

R works with data "in-memory." When the size of data loaded in the session
exceeds available memory, it starts using harddisk for memory, which is about 
an order of magnitude slower. Check out the `Grid View` of the `Environment` 
tab in Rstudio. You can sort by object size to see if you're lugging around a 
bunch of big items and what's taking up space. You can remove items from the 
active environment (this doesn't touch anything on disk, but you'll have to 
re-load/create it to get it back in R) with `rm(object_name)`. More detail on 
memory usage can be found in [Hadley's book, "Advanced R."](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/memory.html)

```{r}
library(healthcareai)
d <- d %>%
  mutate(arr_delay = case_when(arr_delay > 15 ~ "Y",
                               TRUE ~ "N"),
         flight_id = 1:nrow(d)) %>%
  select(-dep_time, -arr_time, -dep_delay, hour, minute)
d_clean <- d %>% 
  prep_data(outcome = arr_delay,
            ... = tailnum,
            collapse_rare_factors = FALSE, 
            add_levels = FALSE)
dim(d_clean)
os <- object.size(d_clean)
print(paste("Prepped data is", round(as.numeric(os)/1000000, 1), "mb."))
```

## Categorical Variables
Categorical columns must be multiplied into *dummy columns* for machine learning. 
For example, `carrier` has 16 unique values and those will be turned into 16
unique columns. These dummy columns are made up of 1s and 0s. There is one dummy
column for each unique value in the original column except one. The missing 
value can be inferred from a 0 in the rest of the columns. For example, if your
gender column contained `Male` and `Female`, you would get 1 dummy column, 
`Gender_Male`, where males were `1`. Females would then be the `0`'s. If you
wanted that dummy column to instead be `Gender_Female`, you can use the prep
data argument, `ref_data`, like this:  `ref_levels = c(gender = "Female")`. `prep_data`
then adds a column to collect missing values in the original column.

Be careful with categorical columns, as they can blow up your data set. If you had 
a column of DRG codes (or `tailnums`, which was removed above) with 100s of 
unique values, your data would become hundreds of columns!
```{r}
print(paste("Carrier has", unique(d$carrier) %>% length(), "unique values."))

d_clean %>%
  select(starts_with("carrier"))
```

## Limiting Width
One of the best ways to reduce training time and memory requirements is to limit 
the number of columns in the data. Here are some easy ways to do it.

### Understand High Cardinality Variables
Since character variables with lots of unique values, or *high cardinality variables*, 
cause very wide datasets, the best way to limit width is understanding which
columns those are and whether or not you need them in your data. How many 
unique values are in a character column, like `destination`?
```{r}
d %>%
  summarize_if(~ is.character(.x) | is.factor(.x) , n_distinct)
```

What about how those values correlate with the outcome? In this case, we'll do
a visualization of `destination`, looking at the proportion of each that belongs
to the delayed group.
```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5}
d %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(dest, arr_delay, function(x) -sum(x == "Y") / length(x)), 
             fill = arr_delay)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .5)) +
  xlab("Destination") +
  ylab("Proporition Delayed")
```

But really, you want to know what the distribution of all your variables looks like. 
You should **profile your data** using the `DataExplorer` package. It gives you 
all sorts of good info about your data and generates an HTML report that you can 
refer back to later to know if your data might have changed. [Check out an 
example here.](https://github.com/boxuancui/DataExplorer)

### Remove or Transform Columns
The simplest option is to remove categorical or date columns with more than say, 
50 categories. You might throw out some information, but you can always add it
back in later if you need. You'll notice that's what I did above by ignoring `tailnum`,
which has 4000 categories and doesn't likely contain much useful information.

We saw in the plot that `destination`, definitely has useful information as some
destinations are rarely delayed while others are routinely delayed. 105 
categories is simply too many to just include it though. Here, the 
`collapse_rare_factors` argument to `prep_data` can help with that lumping some
of the rare categories into an "other" category. This example puts any category that
contains less than 2% of the total data into "other." `destination` is shrunk to the 
16 most common destinations.
```{r}
d_clean2 <- d %>%
  mutate(hour_of_day = lubridate::hour(time_hour)) %>%
  prep_data(outcome = arr_delay,
            ... = tailnum,
            collapse_rare_factors = 0.02)

d_clean2 %>%
  select(starts_with("dest"))
```

By default, `prep_data` will also transform dates into categorical columns that 
make the dataset larger. That can be good, as there planes might tend to be more
often delayed in snowy January than cool October. Categorical months
are technically more correct than numeric months as January (1) is not less than February 
(2). Similarly, an `hour_of_day` column could be a categorical column or a 
numeric. Categorical columns will create a larger dataset but will perform better 
using GLM. It's fine to leave these as numeric for tree-based methods like
random forest or xgboost.

Using categorical dates, needed for GLM, we get 81 columns. That might be slow.
```{r}
library(lubridate)
d_clean2 <- d %>%
  mutate(hour_of_day = as.character(hour(time_hour))) %>%
  prep_data(outcome = arr_delay, 
            ... = tailnum,
            collapse_rare_factors = 0.02,
            convert_dates = "categories")
d_clean2
```
If we want numeric dates, fine for RF or XGB, we can specify that. 
With numeric dates, 46 columns remain.
```{r}
d_clean2 <- d %>%
  prep_data(outcome = arr_delay, 
            ... = tailnum,
            collapse_rare_factors = 0.02,
            convert_dates = "continuous")
d_clean2
```

### Select Best Levels
Some categories, like `tailnum`, are not handled well by  the
`collapse_rare_factors` argument. There are too many categories and they are fairly
evenly distributed. They all get moved into category `other`, which doesn't 
help at all. You could remove them by passing them to the `...` argument of 
`prep_data`, as I did with tailnum.

An alternative to grouping rare categories is to use `add_best_levels` to make
columns for the categories (or levels) that are likely to help differentiate the 
outcome variable. This function can be used for any grouping variable, like
zip code.

The following example will identify 20 tail numbers that could be predictive of 
the outcome. Instead of removing tail number, These are good levels to add to try adding to
the data with `bind_cols`. Similarly, you could select the best `dest` values by
using `dest` as the grouping variable.
```{r}
data <- d %>% select(flight_id, arr_delay)
ls <- d %>% select(flight_id, tailnum, arr_delay)

d_best_levels <- data %>%
  add_best_levels(longsheet = ls,
                  id = flight_id,
                  groups = tailnum,
                  outcome = arr_delay,
                  n_levels = 20,
                  min_obs = 50,
                  missing_fill = 0)
d_best_levels
```


## Limiting Length
At some point, adding more rows of data will no longer improve performance. 
Better data will always win against more of the same bad data.

If you have a large data set, like `flights`, you probably have enough information
to do machine learning on a subset and still get good results. 
Some common ways to reduce length:

Sample a random subset of data. This keeps half the original data with the same
ratio of delayed to not delayed.
```{r}
stratified_sample_d <- d %>%
  split_train_test(outcome = arr_delay, percent_train = .5)
stratified_sample_d <- stratified_sample_d$train

d %>% 
  count(arr_delay) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

stratified_sample_d %>% 
  count(arr_delay) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Use only data from the last year or 2. Healthcare data often goes back several
years, but you might find that data from 5 years ago isn't as predictive as more
current data anyways! 
```{r}
# From an integer month column
d_recent <- d %>% 
  filter(month >= 6)

# From a date column
d_recent <- d %>%
  filter(lubridate::month(time_hour) >= 6)
```

In the case of unbalanced data sets, where there are many more "No" than "Yes"
outcomes, throw out some of the "No" rows.
```{r}
downsampled_d <- caret::downSample(d, as.factor(d$arr_delay)) %>%
  select(-Class, -tailnum)

downsampled_d %>% 
  count(arr_delay) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

# Models
Let's train a model to predict whether a plane arrived more than
15 minutes late or not. The first thing you might do is use `machine_learn`.
I stopped this code after I saw the warning message.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
m <- machine_learn(downsampled_d, outcome = arr_delay)
```
```
Training new data prep recipe
Removing the following 1 near-zero variance column(s). If you don't want to remove them, call prep_data with remove_near_zero_variance = FALSE.
year
arr_delay looks categorical, so training classification algorithms.
You've chosen to tune 150 models (n_folds = 5 x tune_depth = 10 x length(models) = 3) on a 336,776 row dataset. This may take a while...
Training with cross validation: Random Forest
```

Notice that `machine_learn` gives the warning message that says it will be training
150 models! Under the hood, this function is doing some seriously rigorous 
machine learning for you:

- It is doing *5-fold cross validation*. This means that it's training 5 models 
with 80/20 splits of training and testing. This ensures that all data is part of
the test set once.
- It is *tuning hyperparmeters* using *random search* with 10 different combinations.
- It is trying 3 different algorithms.

These steps ensure you get the best performing model while still being resistant
to overfitting. They come at the cost of computational complexity. You can speed
things up by using a shorter model list, `models = "rf"`, less hyperparameter
tuning, `tune_depth = 3`, and fewer folds, `n_folds = 4`. Just know that you're 
cutting corners for the sake of time. We recommend doing your development work 
quickly using `flash_models` but then doing the full tune before saving your 
final model.

## flash_models for Speed
We can use `prep_data` and `flash_models` to get an idea of how long our models will take to 
train. `flash_models` requires at least 2 folds, meaning 2 models, each trained
on half the data. We recommend using at least 4 folds. If 4 models takes 6.5 
minutes, 150 models will be in the ballpark of 4 hours. 
```{r}
start <- Sys.time()
d_clean <- downsampled_d %>%
  prep_data(outcome = arr_delay, 
            collapse_rare_factors = 0.03,
            convert_dates = FALSE)

m_rf_1 <- flash_models(d_clean, 
                       outcome = arr_delay, 
                       models = "rf",
                       n_folds = 4)
Sys.time() - start
```
```{r}
m_rf_1
```

If you don't need the finer control of your data preparation, `machine_learn` 
with `tune = FALSE` is equivalent to `prep_data %>% flash_models`. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
m <- machine_learn(d,    
                   outcome = arr_delay,
                   models = "rf",
                   tune = FALSE,
                   n_folds = 4)
```                  

## GLM for Speed
As different models take different amounts of time, it's good to know what
performance looks like using both before choosing one to go forward with. 
Hyperparameter tuning with GLM is very efficient. However, in some situations, 
it won't be as accurate as other models, and it can be slower on very wide datasets (hundreds of columns).

On our `flights` data, GLM was faster, taking only a quarter of the time RF did. 
Its performance was not as high though. RF had an AUPR of 0.72 while GLM was 0.69. 
The performance increase could potentially be worth your time as random forest appears to 
better fit the data.
```{r}
start <- Sys.time()
d_clean <- downsampled_d %>%
  prep_data(outcome = arr_delay, 
            collapse_rare_factors = 0.03,
            convert_dates = FALSE)

m_glm_1 <- flash_models(d_clean, 
                        outcome = arr_delay, 
                        models = "glm",
                        n_folds = 4)
Sys.time() - start
```
```{r}
m_glm_1
```

## Limited Tuning
Now that you've settled on a model, you could use either `machine_learn` with just 
that model or `tune_models` with selected tuning options. This gives you a 
little more rigor than our svelte `flash_models` but won't take 4 hours.
```{r}
start <- Sys.time()
d_clean <- downsampled_d %>%
  prep_data(outcome = arr_delay, 
            collapse_rare_factors = 0.03,
            convert_dates = FALSE)
m_glm_2 <-
  tune_models(d = d_clean,
              outcome = arr_delay,
              models = "glm",
              tune_depth = 5)
Sys.time() - start
```

```{r}
m_glm_2
```
We got different performance than when we used `flash_models`. Why? 
Hyperparameters are chosen randomly. We could have gotten lucky before. Using
5-fold cross validation is more rigorous as well. It will uncover any differences
there might be in subsets of the data and more closely mimic the production 
environment.

Before simply getting more memory on your computer, try the above on your data.
Hopefully, you end up with a better model in less time!
