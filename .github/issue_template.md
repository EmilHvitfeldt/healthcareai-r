Hello! We appreciate that you've come here to offer feedback of some sort. If you have a general question about how to use the package, consider asking on [Slack](https://healthcare-ai.slack.com/) for a faster response.

## Feature Requests

Letting us know how healthcareai could be more useful for you help us make it better. Don't worry about asking; we may not get to it right away, but we're happy to know what you want. Please include what you'd like the package to do and what you would use the functionality for.

## Bug Reports

Did you find a new way to break `healthcareai`? We're happy you came here to tell us about it. We want to help, but it can be very difficult to diagnose a problem that happened on another machine. To help with that please include the following:

#### A minimal reproducable example

These help us recreate your problem on our machine. [This is a good guide](https://gist.github.com/hadley/270442) on how to write a reproducable example. The [reprex package](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) is extraordinarily helpful
for this. If you need to include data to recreate the issue, you can paste the output of `dput(your_data)` here.

#### The output of `sessionInfo()`
